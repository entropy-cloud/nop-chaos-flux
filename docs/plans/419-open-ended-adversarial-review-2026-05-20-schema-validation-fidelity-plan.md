## Purpose

收口 `R03-01`、`R03-02`、`R03-03`、`R05-01`：让 schema authoring validation 与 live compile/runtime semantics 重新对齐。

## Current Baseline

- live compiler validation 已覆盖 lifecycle actions 的 shape validation。
- `RendererPropContract.required` 缺失字段现在会在 schema validation 时报错。
- `reaction` 当前已校验 `watch`、control fields、以及 `actions`。
- built-in `ajax` action 的 `args: ApiSchema` 当前已按专门 shape validation 处理。

## Goals

- 修复 `R03-01`, `R03-02`, `R03-03`, `R05-01`。
- 让 compile/validate/runtime 的语义边界重新一致。
- 补齐 focused proof，并同步受影响 owner docs。

## Non-Goals

- 不处理 compiler diagnostic fidelity；那属于 Plan `399` 已完成 surface。
- 不处理 repository automation / check-chain wiring；那属于 Plan `418`。
- 不在本计划内泛化到 every possible schema special-case unless required by the retained findings.

## Scope

### In Scope

- `R03-01`, `R03-02`, `R03-03`, `R05-01`
- relevant compiler/core/runtime validation files and focused proof
- `docs/architecture/flux-core.md`
- `docs/architecture/renderer-runtime.md`
- `docs/architecture/complex-control-host-protocol.md`
- `docs/architecture/api-data-source.md`
- `docs/architecture/action-algebra-formal-spec.md` if the supported action authoring baseline changes
- `docs/logs/2026/05-20.md`

### Out Of Scope

- unrelated compiler diagnostics
- unrelated automation guardrail scripts

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1 - Restore Schema Validation Parity

Status: completed
Targets: schema validation code, focused proof, affected owner docs

- Item Types: `Fix | Proof`

- [x] Add honest validation paths for the in-scope lifecycle, required-prop, reaction, and built-in ajax payload contracts.
- [x] Add focused proof that invalid authored shapes fail at validation time rather than degrading into runtime-only failures.
- [x] Adjudicate owner-doc impact explicitly: `docs/architecture/flux-core.md`, `docs/architecture/renderer-runtime.md`, `docs/architecture/complex-control-host-protocol.md`, `docs/architecture/api-data-source.md`, and `docs/architecture/action-algebra-formal-spec.md` already described the final supported contract, so no owner-doc text change was required for this slice.

Exit Criteria:

- [x] `R03-01`, `R03-02`, `R03-03`, and `R05-01` are fixed.
- [x] Focused proof covers the final validation behavior for all retained in-scope contracts.
- [x] No owner-doc update required: `docs/architecture/flux-core.md`, `docs/architecture/renderer-runtime.md`, `docs/architecture/complex-control-host-protocol.md`, `docs/architecture/api-data-source.md`, and `docs/architecture/action-algebra-formal-spec.md` already matched the supported baseline after the code fix.
- [x] `docs/logs/2026/05-20.md` is updated.

## Closure Gates

- [x] The in-scope retained findings are fixed.
- [x] Required owner-doc updates are landed.
- [x] No in-scope retained finding is silently downgraded to deferred or follow-up.
- [x] Independent subagent closure audit is completed and recorded.
- [x] `pnpm typecheck`
- [x] `pnpm build`
- [x] `pnpm lint`
- [x] `pnpm test`

## Closure

Status Note: Schema validation now rejects missing required renderer props, malformed lifecycle actions, malformed `reaction` watch/control fields, and invalid built-in `ajax` payloads at validation time instead of relying on runtime degradation. Focused proof, repo-wide verification, and independent closure audit are complete, and the named owner docs already matched the final supported contract.

Closure Audit Evidence:

- Reviewer / Agent: independent general subagent
- Evidence: `ses_1bb02c7feffeSJyOIc1GfmNQsL` (`Verdict: acceptable`, `Findings: none`), recorded in `docs/logs/2026/05-20.md`

Follow-up:

- no remaining plan-owned work
